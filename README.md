Database Management System (DBMS)
Welcome to the DBMS repository! This project is designed to provide a thorough exploration of Database Management Systems using SQL. It serves as a practical guide for learning and mastering essential SQL concepts and operations, whether you are just starting or seeking to deepen your knowledge.

Overview
This repository offers a structured approach to understanding and implementing key aspects of DBMS:

1. Base Table Creation
Table Design: Learn the principles of designing efficient and well-structured database tables. This includes understanding how to define columns, set data types, and establish primary and foreign keys.
Table Creation: Step-by-step examples demonstrating how to create tables using SQL. Covers syntax, constraints, and best practices for ensuring data integrity.
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations
INSERT Operations: Techniques for adding new records to tables. Includes examples of single and bulk inserts, as well as handling default values and constraints.
UPDATE Operations: Methods for modifying existing records. Learn how to apply updates conditionally and manage changes across multiple records.
DELETE Operations: Approaches for removing records. Focuses on safe deletion practices, including how to avoid accidental data loss and manage dependent records.
SELECT Queries: Strategies for querying and retrieving data. Includes simple and complex queries, filtering results, sorting data, and using joins to combine information from multiple tables.
3. SQL Queries and Examples
Practical Examples: A collection of SQL queries and scripts for various scenarios. Each example is designed to illustrate specific concepts and techniques, with clear explanations to aid understanding.
Query Optimization: Tips and practices for writing efficient SQL queries that perform well even with large datasets.
4. Database Design and Normalization
Database Design Basics: Fundamentals of designing a relational database, including entity-relationship modeling and schema design.
Normalization: Introduction to normalization techniques to eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency. Covers normal forms and the process of transforming a database schema to meet normalization standards.
5. Advanced Topics (Planned)
Indexing: Techniques for creating and using indexes to improve query performance.
Transactions: Understanding database transactions, including concepts like ACID properties and transaction management.
Performance Tuning: Strategies for optimizing database performance, including query optimization and hardware considerations.
Getting Started
